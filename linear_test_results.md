## Linear Sales Intelligence Summary

**Company Overview & Value Proposition:**
Linear is a project planning and issue tracking platform that positions itself as bringing "magic back to software development." They solve the core problem of fragmented, slow product development workflows by providing a unified system that streamlines the entire product development process. Their primary value proposition centers on speed, quality, and user experience - they've evolved from a simple issue tracker into a comprehensive project management tool that teams "actually enjoy using." Linear targets product development teams ranging from early-stage startups to public companies, with notable enterprise customers including OpenAI, Brex, Ramp, Scale, and Mercury. Their messaging emphasizes "software craftsmanship" and appeals to teams that prioritize quality and fast execution.

**Business Model & Products:**
Linear operates on a freemium SaaS model with four tiers: Free ($0 for unlimited members, 2 teams, 250 issues), Basic ($8/user/month for 5 teams and unlimited issues), Business ($14/user/month adding advanced features like Linear Insights and unlimited teams), and Enterprise (custom pricing with SAML, SCIM, and advanced security). They serve over 10,000 organizations and have demonstrated strong product-market fit with customers reporting 2x increase in filed issues and 1.6x faster issue resolution after switching. Core features include issues, projects, cycles, initiatives, integrations with Slack/GitHub, API access, and advanced analytics through Linear Insights. Their customer success stories emphasize consolidating fragmented planning tools and accelerating development velocity.

**Company Maturity & Sales Context:**
Linear is a well-funded, remote-first company founded by experienced entrepreneurs (Karri Saarinen, Jori Lallo, Tuomas Artman) with a distributed team across North America and Europe. They're actively hiring and appear to be in growth stage, having moved beyond startup phase given their enterprise customer base and sophisticated product offering. The sales process appears hybrid - strong self-serve motion for smaller teams with dedicated enterprise sales for larger accounts (evidenced by "contact sales" CTAs on Business tier and custom Enterprise pricing). Technical decision-makers are primary buyers, but the tool's focus on consolidating planning workflows suggests involvement from product management and engineering leadership. The 14-day cycles and quality-focused culture indicate they're selling to sophisticated development teams that value operational excellence over basic project management.
