# Enhanced Logging Implementation - Detailed URL Tracking & Console Output

## Problem Addressed ✅

**Issue**: The UI progress log was showing generic messages like "Link Discovery: running" without showing individual URLs being crawled, and the console had no detailed logging of the scraping process.

**User Request**: 
1. Show each page being crawled with full URLs
2. Display detailed console logs of pages crawled  
3. Show what's being sent to the LLM
4. More helpful and specific progress tracking

---

## Solution Implemented ✅

### **Enhanced Console & UI Logging in `src/intelligent_company_scraper.py`**

### 1. **Phase 1: Link Discovery - Enhanced URL Tracking**

**robots.txt Analysis**:
```python
# Console Output:
print(f"🔍 Analyzing robots.txt: {robots_url}", flush=True)
print(f"✅ Found {len(robots_links)} links from robots.txt", flush=True)

# UI Progress Log:
progress_logger.add_to_progress_log(job_id, f"🔍 Analyzing robots.txt: {robots_url}")
progress_logger.add_to_progress_log(job_id, f"✅ robots.txt: {len(robots_links)} links discovered")
```

**sitemap.xml Analysis**:
```python
# Console Output:
print(f"🔍 Analyzing sitemap.xml: {sitemap_url}", flush=True)
print(f"✅ Found {len(sitemap_links)} links from sitemap.xml", flush=True)

# UI Progress Log:
progress_logger.add_to_progress_log(job_id, f"🔍 Analyzing sitemap.xml: {sitemap_url}")
progress_logger.add_to_progress_log(job_id, f"✅ sitemap.xml: {len(sitemap_links)} links discovered")
```

**Recursive Crawling - Individual Page Tracking**:
```python
# Console Output:
print(f"🔍 Starting recursive crawling from: {base_url}", flush=True)
print(f"🕷️  Crawling page (depth {current_depth}): {base_url}", flush=True)
print(f"✅ Found {len(crawled_links)} links from recursive crawling", flush=True)

# UI Progress Log:
progress_logger.add_to_progress_log(job_id, f"🔍 Starting recursive crawling from: {base_url}")
progress_logger.add_to_progress_log(job_id, f"🕷️ Crawling depth {current_depth}: {base_url}")
progress_logger.add_to_progress_log(job_id, f"✅ Recursive crawl: {len(crawled_links)} links discovered")
```

### 2. **Phase 2: LLM Page Selection - Detailed Prompt & Response Logging**

**All Links Sent to LLM**:
```python
# Console Output:
print(f"🧠 Links being sent to LLM for analysis:", flush=True)
for i, link in enumerate(limited_links, 1):
    print(f"  {i:2d}. {link}", flush=True)

# UI Progress Log:
progress_logger.add_to_progress_log(job_id, f"📋 Link {i}: {link}")
progress_logger.add_to_progress_log(job_id, f"🧠 Sending {len(limited_links)} links to LLM for intelligent selection...")
```

**LLM Prompt & Response Details**:
```python
# Console Output:
print(f"🧠 PROMPT PREVIEW (first 500 chars):", flush=True)
print(f"{'='*60}", flush=True)
print(prompt[:500] + "..." if len(prompt) > 500 else prompt, flush=True)
print(f"{'='*60}", flush=True)

print(f"🧠 RESPONSE PREVIEW (first 500 chars):", flush=True)
print(f"{'='*60}", flush=True)
print(response[:500] + "..." if len(response) > 500 else response, flush=True)
print(f"{'='*60}", flush=True)

# UI Progress Log:
progress_logger.add_to_progress_log(job_id, f"🧠 Sending prompt to LLM ({len(prompt)} chars)")
progress_logger.add_to_progress_log(job_id, f"🧠 Received LLM response ({len(response)} chars)")
```

### 3. **Phase 3: Content Extraction - Individual Page Results**

**Per-Page Extraction Status**:
```python
# Console Output:
print(f"📄 [{current_page}/{total_pages}] Extracting content from: {url}", flush=True)
print(f"✅ [{current_page}/{total_pages}] Success: {len(content)} chars from {content_source} - {url}", flush=True)
print(f"❌ [{current_page}/{total_pages}] No content extracted - {url}", flush=True)
print(f"❌ [{current_page}/{total_pages}] Crawl failed - {url}", flush=True)
print(f"❌ [{current_page}/{total_pages}] Exception: {str(e)} - {url}", flush=True)

# UI Progress Log:
progress_logger.add_to_progress_log(job_id, f"📄 [{current_page}/{total_pages}] Extracting: {url}")
progress_logger.add_to_progress_log(job_id, f"✅ [{current_page}/{total_pages}] Success: {len(content)} chars - {url}")
progress_logger.add_to_progress_log(job_id, f"❌ [{current_page}/{total_pages}] No content - {url}")
```

## Technical Implementation Details 🔧

### **Console Logging Pattern**:
```python
print(f"🔍 Action: Description with URL", flush=True)
# Always use flush=True for immediate console output
```

### **UI Progress Pattern**:
```python
if job_id:
    progress_logger.add_to_progress_log(job_id, f"🔍 Action: Description with URL")
```

### **Error Handling Pattern**:
```python
try:
    # Operation
    print(f"✅ Success: details", flush=True)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"❌ Failed: {e}", flush=True)
    if job_id:
        progress_logger.add_to_progress_log(job_id, f"❌ Failed: {e}")
```

### **LLM Interaction Pattern**:
```python
print(f"🧠 PROMPT PREVIEW:", flush=True)
print(f"{'='*60}", flush=True)
print(prompt[:500] + "...", flush=True)
print(f"{'='*60}", flush=True)
```
