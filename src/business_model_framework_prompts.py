**Value Mechanism Description - Explain in parentheses HOW the company monetizes:**
Must include these four elements:
- **WHO** pays (customer type: enterprises, consumers, SMBs, government, etc.)
- **WHAT** they pay for (specific product/service)
- **HOW** pricing works (per-user, per-transaction, fixed fee, monthly subscription, etc.)
- **WHY** customers pay (value received: efficiency gains, cost savings, new capabilities, etc.)

**Quality Requirements:**
- Concise: 1-2 sentences maximum
- Specific: Include concrete details about pricing and value where available

Value Proposition: {value_proposition}
Target Market: {target_market}
Products/Services: {products_services_offered}

Competitive Advantages: {competitive_advantages}
AI Summary: {ai_summary}

**Generate ONLY the business model description following the exact framework format above. Do not include explanations or additional text.**
