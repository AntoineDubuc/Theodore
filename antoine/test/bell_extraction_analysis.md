# Bell.ca Extraction Analysis Report

## Summary

The test reveals that Antoine's extraction system IS working, but there are some issues in the pipeline that result in empty results in the UI:

## Key Findings

### 1. Nova Pro Selection Issue (CRITICAL)
- **Problem**: Nova Pro selected 0 paths from 544 discovered paths
- **Impact**: The extraction has to fall back to manual path selection
- **Root Cause**: The selection prompt may be too complex or the confidence threshold too high

### 2. Successful Extraction Despite Selection Issues
When using fallback paths, the system successfully extracted:
- **71 total fields** from Bell.ca
- **67 non-null fields** (94% success rate)
- High-quality data including:
  - Company name: Bell Canada
  - Founded: 1880
  - Location: Montreal, Quebec, Canada
  - Employee count: Over 20,000
  - Business model: B2C, B2B subscription-based
  - Contact info: Phone and email
  - Social media: All major platforms
  - Leadership: CEO Mirko Bibic

### 3. Page Crawling Issues
- Only 3 of 5 pages were successfully crawled
- Failed pages: `/Contact-us` and `/About-Bell`
- This suggests some pages may have anti-crawling measures

### 4. Performance Metrics
- Discovery: 1.16s (544 paths found)
- Selection: 54.23s (Nova Pro timeout issue?)
- Crawling: 4.96s (3 pages)
- Extraction: 11.60s
- Total cost: $0.014 ($0.0112 + $0.0030)

## Root Cause of Empty UI Results

The empty results in the UI are likely due to:

1. **Selection Failure**: Nova Pro is selecting 0 paths, which means no content is extracted
2. **Pipeline Dependency**: The UI may not handle the fallback scenario properly
3. **Error Propagation**: Selection errors may not be properly handled in the adapter

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes:
1. **Lower selection confidence threshold** from 0.6 to 0.3
2. **Implement better fallback logic** in the selection phase
3. **Add heuristic selection** as a backup when Nova fails
4. **Fix error handling** in the scraper adapter

### Testing Improvements:
1. Test with different companies to see if this is Bell-specific
2. Monitor Nova Pro selection responses for patterns
3. Add debug logging to the UI pipeline

## Conclusion

The Antoine extraction system DOES work and can extract comprehensive company data. The issue is in the selection phase where Nova Pro is being too restrictive and selecting no paths. With proper fallback logic, the system successfully extracts 67+ fields from Bell.ca.
