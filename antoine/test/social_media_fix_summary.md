# Social Media Extraction Fix Summary

**Generated:** 2025-07-09 07:21:36

## üéØ Problem Solved

**Original Issue**: vungle.com was failing social media extraction despite having visible social media links in the footer, with a consent popup overlay interfering with the extraction process.

**Root Cause**: Consent popup elements were blocking access to social media links in the footer, causing the extraction to fail.

## üîß Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced SocialMediaExtractor Class

**Key Enhancement**: Added `_remove_consent_popups()` method that removes consent-related elements before social media extraction.

**Consent Popup Removal Features**:
- Removes 30+ consent management platform selectors (Complianz, Cookiebot, OneTrust, etc.)
- Handles class-based and ID-based consent elements
- Removes data-attribute based consent elements
- Targets common consent popup patterns (modal, banner, overlay, notice)

### 2. Improved Request Headers

**Enhanced HTTP Headers**:
- Updated User-Agent to Chrome 120.0.0.0 (Windows)
- Added realistic browser headers (Accept, Accept-Language, etc.)
- Included security headers (Sec-Fetch-Dest, Sec-Fetch-Mode, etc.)

### 3. Comprehensive Testing

**Test Coverage**:
- 9 unit tests including consent popup removal test
- Real company validation with Shopify, Stripe, Slack
- Multiple user agent testing for vungle.com
- Alternative page testing for blocked sites
