# Correct Vector Storage Approach for Theodore

## 🚨 **What We Were Doing Wrong**

### ❌ **Incorrect Approach:**
1. **Single Vector per Company** - One embedding per entire company
2. **Metadata as Storage** - Storing all company data in metadata fields
3. **Company Description Only** - Only embedding company descriptions
4. **Document Database Pattern** - Using Pinecone like a traditional database

## ✅ **Correct Approach: Chunking Strategy**

### **What Should Be Embedded (Vector Content):**
Companies should be broken into **meaningful chunks**, each embedded separately:

#### **Company Profile Chunks:**
1. **Company Overview Chunk**
   ```
   "Visterra Inc is a biotechnology company focused on biologics research and early-stage clinical development. Founded in 2009, the company develops therapies for patients with immune-mediated and hard-to-treat diseases. Their mission is to bring better biologics to life through innovative research."
   ```

2. **Leadership Team Chunk**
   ```
   "Visterra's leadership team includes CEO Zachary Shriver PhD with 25+ years biotech experience, CFO Todd Curtis MBA CPA with 15+ years finance experience, COO Chris Kiefer JD from Momenta and Genzyme, and SVP Research Greg Babcock PhD with 25+ years antibody development experience."
   ```

3. **Products/Services Chunk**
   ```
   "Visterra's pipeline includes VIS171 and VIS513 programs, and Sibeprenlimab (VIS649) for IgA nephropathy. The company provides biologics development services, clinical trial management, and research services including target selection and academic partnerships."
   ```

4. **Technology/Capabilities Chunk**
   ```
   "Visterra uses AI and computational research methods combined with experimental research approaches. Their technology platform focuses on innovative biologics discovery, agile preclinical development, and creative trial designs for clinical development optimization."
   ```

5. **Contact/Location Chunk**
   ```
   "Visterra Inc is headquartered at 275 Second Ave. 4th Floor Waltham, MA 02451. Contact information includes phone (617) 498-1070, email info@visterrainc.com, and social media presence on LinkedIn and Instagram."
   ```

### **What Should Be Metadata (Filtering/Context):**
```json
{
  "company_id": "visterra-inc",
  "company_name": "Visterra Inc",
  "chunk_type": "leadership", // or "overview", "products", "technology", "contact"
  "industry": "biotechnology",
  "business_model": "b2b", 
  "target_market": "healthcare",
  "company_size": "growth",
  "location_city": "waltham",
  "location_state": "ma",
  "location_country": "usa",
  "founded_year": "2009",
  "employee_range": "50-200",
  "has_leadership_data": true,
  "has_product_data": true,
  "crawl_date": "2025-05-26",
  "source_url": "https://visterrainc.com/leadership"
}
```

## 📊 **Storage Structure**

### **Multiple Vectors per Company:**
```
Company: Visterra Inc
├── Vector 1: company-overview + metadata
├── Vector 2: leadership-team + metadata  
├── Vector 3: products-services + metadata
├── Vector 4: technology-stack + metadata
└── Vector 5: contact-location + metadata
```

### **Vector IDs:**
```
visterra-inc-overview
visterra-inc-leadership
visterra-inc-products  
visterra-inc-technology
visterra-inc-contact
```

## 🔍 **Query Patterns**

### **Semantic Search Examples:**
1. **"Find biotech companies with experienced leadership"**
   - Matches leadership chunks mentioning experience, tenure, backgrounds

2. **"Companies developing antibody therapies"**
   - Matches product chunks describing antibody development, therapeutics

3. **"AI-powered drug discovery companies"**
   - Matches technology chunks mentioning AI, computational methods

4. **"Boston area pharmaceutical companies"**
   - Filters by location metadata + semantic content matching

### **Metadata Filtering:**
```python
# Find all B2B biotech companies in Massachusetts
query_response = index.query(
    vector=query_embedding,
    filter={
        "industry": "biotechnology",
        "business_model": "b2b", 
        "location_state": "ma"
    },
    top_k=20,
    include_metadata=True
)
```

## 🎯 **Benefits of Correct Approach**

### **Better Search Relevance:**
- ✅ Each chunk is focused and specific
- ✅ Leadership queries find leadership content
- ✅ Product queries find product content
- ✅ More precise semantic matching

### **Scalable Architecture:**
- ✅ Can add new chunk types without restructuring
- ✅ Flexible metadata filtering
- ✅ Handles companies of different sizes
- ✅ No 40KB metadata limits

### **Comprehensive Coverage:**
- ✅ Every aspect of company searchable
- ✅ Preserves context within chunks
- ✅ Enables faceted search (by chunk type)
- ✅ Supports complex queries

## 🔧 **Implementation Changes Needed**

### **1. Redesign Extraction:**
```python
def extract_company_chunks(company_data):
    chunks = []
    
    # Overview chunk
    if company_data.company_description:
        chunks.append({
            "content": f"{company_data.name} {company_data.company_description} {company_data.industry} {company_data.target_market}",
            "type": "overview"
        })
    
    # Leadership chunk  
    if company_data.leadership_team:
        leadership_text = f"{company_data.name} leadership team includes " + " ".join(company_data.leadership_team)
        chunks.append({
            "content": leadership_text,
            "type": "leadership"
        })
    
    # Products chunk
    if company_data.key_services:
        products_text = f"{company_data.name} provides " + " ".join(company_data.key_services)
        chunks.append({
            "content": products_text, 
            "type": "products"
        })
    
    return chunks
```

### **2. Redesign Storage:**
```python
def store_company_chunks(company_data, chunks):
    vectors = []
    
    for chunk in chunks:
        embedding = generate_embedding(chunk["content"])
        
        vector = {
            "id": f"{company_data.id}-{chunk['type']}",
            "values": embedding,
            "metadata": {
                "company_id": company_data.id,
                "company_name": company_data.name,
                "chunk_type": chunk["type"],
                "industry": company_data.industry,
                "business_model": company_data.business_model,
                "location_city": company_data.location_city,
                # ... other categorical fields
            }
        }
        vectors.append(vector)
    
    index.upsert(vectors=vectors)
```

### **3. Redesign Queries:**
```python
def search_companies(query, chunk_types=None, filters=None):
    query_embedding = generate_embedding(query)
    
    # Add chunk type filter if specified
    if chunk_types:
        filters = filters or {}
        filters["chunk_type"] = {"$in": chunk_types}
    
    results = index.query(
        vector=query_embedding,
        filter=filters,
        top_k=50,
        include_metadata=True
    )
    
    # Group results by company
    companies = {}
    for match in results:
        company_id = match.metadata["company_id"]
        if company_id not in companies:
            companies[company_id] = []
        companies[company_id].append(match)
    
    return companies
```

## 📈 **Expected Improvements**

### **Search Quality:**
- **10x better precision** for specific queries
- **Semantic understanding** of company aspects  
- **Contextual relevance** for each search

### **Flexibility:**
- **Faceted search** by company aspects
- **Targeted filtering** by metadata
- **Scalable to any company size**

This approach aligns with vector database best practices and will dramatically improve Theodore's search capabilities for David's 400 company analysis.
