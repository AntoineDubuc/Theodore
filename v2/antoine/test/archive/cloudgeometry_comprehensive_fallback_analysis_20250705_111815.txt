3. Exclude Non-Primary Pages  
   - Legal/policy (`/privacy`, `/terms`)  
   - Account/utilities (`/login`, `/signup`, `/cart`, `/search`)  
   - Support/FAQ (`/help`, `/support`, `/faq`)  
   - Structural (`/sitemap`, pagination links)  

4. Output  
   - Return a JSON object with selected paths and explanations for each path:
     ```json
