# Theodore v2 Project Charter

## Executive Summary

Theodore v2 is a complete architectural redesign of the Theodore AI Company Intelligence System, transitioning from a monolithic web-first application to a modular, CLI-first platform with plugin architecture. This transformation will enable enterprise scalability, third-party extensibility, and seamless integration into existing workflows.

## Project Vision

Transform Theodore from a web-based tool into a powerful, extensible CLI platform that serves as the foundation for company intelligence gathering, with optional UI layers that can be attached as needed.

## Strategic Goals

1. **CLI-First Architecture**: Build a robust command-line interface as the primary interaction method
2. **Plugin Ecosystem**: Enable third-party developers to extend functionality
3. **Enterprise Scalability**: Support distributed processing and horizontal scaling
4. **API-Driven Design**: Separate concerns between data processing and presentation
5. **Cloud-Native Ready**: Containerized, stateless services suitable for Kubernetes

## Success Criteria

- **Performance**: 50% reduction in research processing time
- **Scalability**: Support for 10x concurrent operations
- **Extensibility**: 10+ community plugins within 6 months
- **Adoption**: 100+ active CLI users within 3 months
- **Quality**: 90%+ test coverage, <1% critical bug rate

## Timeline Overview

**Total Duration**: 12 weeks

- **Phase 1**: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- **Phase 2**: Core Features (Weeks 3-6)
- **Phase 3**: Plugin System (Weeks 7-8)
- **Phase 4**: Testing & Migration (Weeks 9-10)
- **Phase 5**: Documentation & Launch (Weeks 11-12)

## Risk Management

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Data migration failures | High | Medium | Comprehensive backup strategy, rollback plan |
| Plugin security vulnerabilities | High | Medium | Sandboxed execution, security review process |
| Performance regression | Medium | Low | Continuous benchmarking, performance tests |
| Low adoption rate | High | Medium | Developer documentation, migration guides |

## Budget Considerations

- **Development Resources**: 2 senior engineers, 1 junior engineer
- **Infrastructure**: AWS/GCP credits for testing
- **Tools**: GitHub Actions, Docker Hub, monitoring services
- **External Services**: Code signing certificates, security audit

## Communication Plan
