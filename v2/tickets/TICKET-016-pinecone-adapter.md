# TICKET-016: Pinecone Vector Storage Adapter Implementation

## Overview
Implement Pinecone adapter for the VectorStorage interface, handling company embeddings, metadata management, and sophisticated similarity search capabilities for Theodore's AI-powered company intelligence system.

## Problem Statement
Theodore v2 requires a robust vector storage solution for company embeddings and similarity search operations. Current challenges include:
- Need for high-performance vector storage with metadata filtering capabilities
- Support for large-scale embedding storage and retrieval operations
- Efficient similarity search with configurable thresholds and result limits
- Batch operations for optimal performance during bulk company processing
- Index management and optimization for production deployment
- Integration with Theodore's hexagonal architecture and dependency injection
- Proper error handling and retry mechanisms for production reliability

Without a comprehensive Pinecone adapter, Theodore cannot effectively store and retrieve company embeddings or perform the similarity analysis that powers its discovery capabilities.
