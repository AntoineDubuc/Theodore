## Overview
Implement Google Gemini adapter for AI analysis, focusing on the 2.5 Pro model with 1M token context for comprehensive company intelligence processing.

## Problem Statement
Theodore v2 requires a sophisticated AI provider adapter for Google Gemini that can handle large-scale content analysis and aggregation. Current challenges include:
- Need for high-capacity AI processing with 1M+ token context windows
- Support for streaming responses for real-time user feedback
- Efficient handling of large content aggregation from multiple web pages
- Proper rate limiting and cost management for production usage
- Thread-safe concurrent request handling for batch operations
- Integration with Theodore's hexagonal architecture and dependency injection

Without a robust Gemini adapter, Theodore cannot leverage Google's advanced AI capabilities for comprehensive company analysis and content aggregation workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement AIProvider interface for Gemini with complete feature support
- [x] Support Gemini 2.5 Pro configuration with 1M token context handling
- [x] Handle large context windows efficiently with content optimization
- [x] Implement streaming responses for real-time progress feedback
- [x] Track token usage and cost estimation for budget management
- [x] Handle rate limiting with intelligent retry and backoff strategies
- [x] Support concurrent requests with thread-local storage patterns
- [x] Integrate with configuration system for API key management
- [x] Provide comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
- [x] Support content aggregation use cases for multi-page analysis

## Technical Details

### Gemini Adapter Architecture
Integration with Theodore's AI provider system:

```
Gemini Adapter Layer
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GeminiClient (Main interface implementation)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GeminiAnalyzer (Content analysis and aggregation)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GeminiStreamer (Streaming response handling)  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GeminiTokenManager (Usage tracking and cost estimation)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GeminiRateLimiter (Request throttling and retry logic)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ GeminiConfig (Configuration and authentication)
```

### Implementation Strategy
- Use google-generativeai SDK for official Google integration
- Port and enhance logic from v1 GeminiClient implementation
- Support comprehensive content aggregation use cases
- Implement proper timeout handling for large requests
- Use thread-local storage for safe concurrent operations
- Integrate with Theodore's observability and monitoring systems
