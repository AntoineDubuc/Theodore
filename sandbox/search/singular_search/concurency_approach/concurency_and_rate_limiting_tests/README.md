# Rate-Limited Theodore Gemini Solution

This subfolder contains a proper implementation of rate limiting for the Theodore Gemini integration, addressing the quota issues discovered in concurrent testing.

## Problem Addressed

The original concurrent solution immediately exceeded Gemini API rate limits:
- **Free Tier Limit**: 10 requests per minute
- **Our Test**: 10 requests in 7 seconds → instant quota breach
- **Result**: All workers failed with 429 errors

## Solution Approach

### 1. Token Bucket Rate Limiter
- **Algorithm**: Token bucket with configurable capacity and refill rate
- **Benefits**: Allows small bursts while respecting overall rate limits
- **Implementation**: Thread-safe with proper token management

### 2. Rate-Limited Gemini Client
- **Integration**: Built-in rate limiting for all API calls
- **Thread Safety**: Each worker waits for rate limit approval
- **Timeout Handling**: Configurable timeouts for token acquisition

### 3. Conservative Defaults
- **Free Tier**: 8 requests/minute (buffer below 10/minute limit)
- **Single Worker**: Prevents concurrent quota breaches
- **Burst Capacity**: Small burst of 3 tokens maximum

## Implementation Features

### Core Components
- `TokenBucketRateLimiter`: Core rate limiting algorithm
- `RateLimitedGeminiClient`: Gemini client with built-in rate limiting
- `RateLimitedWorkerPool`: Worker pool that respects rate limits
- `RateLimitedTheodoreLLMManager`: Theodore integration layer

### Key Features
- ✅ **Respects API Quotas**: Never exceeds configured rate limits
- ✅ **Thread-Safe**: Multiple workers coordinate through shared rate limiter
- ✅ **Monitoring**: Real-time rate limit status reporting
- ✅ **Graceful Degradation**: Waits for tokens rather than failing
- ✅ **Configurable**: Easy to adjust for different API tiers

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
manager = RateLimitedTheodoreLLMManager(
    max_workers=1,                # Single worker for free tier
    requests_per_minute=8         # Conservative rate limit
)

manager.start()

# Make rate-limited requests
result = manager.analyze_page_selection(job_id, links, company_name)
result = manager.analyze_scraped_content(job_id, company_name, content)

manager.shutdown()
```

### Rate Limit Monitoring
```python
# Check current status
status = manager.get_rate_limit_status()
print(f"Tokens available: {status['tokens_available']}/{status['capacity']}")
print(f"Utilization: {status['utilization']*100:.1f}%")
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Free Tier (8 requests/minute)
- **Single Request**: Immediate (if tokens available)
- **Sequential Requests**: 7.5 second intervals
- **5 Companies**: ~5 minutes total (2 API calls each)
- **Reliability**: 100% (no quota breaches)

### Paid Tier Potential
- **Higher Limits**: Can increase `requests_per_minute` parameter
- **More Workers**: Scale `max_workers` based on API quotas
- **Better Performance**: Much faster processing with higher limits

## Configuration Guidelines

### Free Tier Settings
```python
RateLimitedTheodoreLLMManager(
    max_workers=1,                # Single worker only
    requests_per_minute=8         # Buffer below 10/min limit
)
```

### Paid Tier Settings (Example)
```python
RateLimitedTheodoreLLMManager(
    max_workers=3,                # Multiple workers
    requests_per_minute=50        # Higher rate limit
)
```

## Trade-offs

### Advantages
- ✅ **Never fails due to rate limits**
- ✅ **Predictable performance**
- ✅ **Production-ready reliability**
- ✅ **Easy to configure for different API tiers**

### Disadvantages
- ⚠️ **Slower performance** (especially on free tier)
- ⚠️ **Sequential processing** required for free tier
- ⚠️ **Higher latency** due to rate limiting waits

## Integration Path

1. **Replace Original Client**: Swap `TheodoreLLMManager` with `RateLimitedTheodoreLLMManager`
2. **Configure for API Tier**: Set appropriate rate limits based on Gemini plan
3. **Monitor Performance**: Track rate limit utilization in production
4. **Scale Appropriately**: Adjust workers based on actual API quotas

## Testing Results

The rate-limited solution has been tested and validated to:
- Respect API rate limits without 429 errors
- Provide predictable processing times
- Scale appropriately based on configuration
- Maintain all original functionality with proper rate limiting

This implementation transforms the broken concurrent approach into a production-ready, reliable solution that works within API constraints.
