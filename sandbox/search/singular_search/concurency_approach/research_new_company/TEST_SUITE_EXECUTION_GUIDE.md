This directory contains comprehensive tests for integrating SaaS classification with Theodore's new company research capabilities. The test suite validates the complete end-to-end flow from researching new companies to retrieving their classification data.

## Test Files Created

### 1. `test_research_with_saas_classification.py`
**Complete End-to-End Test**

Tests the full 4-phase workflow:
- **Phase 1**: Research new company using Theodore pipeline
- **Phase 2**: Store company data with classification in Pinecone
- **Phase 3**: Retrieve company data with classification from database  
- **Phase 4**: Validate classification quality and accuracy

**Test Companies:**
- Notion (CollabTech SaaS)
- Vercel (DevOps/CloudInfra SaaS)
- Coinbase (FinTech SaaS)

### 2. `test_saas_classification_retrieval.py`
**Classification Retrieval Analysis**

Tests retrieval and analysis of existing classification data:
- Database coverage analysis
- Individual company classification retrieval
- Data quality validation
- Performance metrics

**Test Targets:**
- Stripe, Linear, Notion, Vercel, Tesla, Deloitte, Coinbase, MongoDB, Shopify, Salesforce

### 3. `phase4_integrated_classification_test.py`
**Integrated Classification Test (Option B)**

Tests combining content aggregation + SaaS classification in single LLM call:
- Integrated Phase 4 approach
- Classification accuracy validation
- Performance vs separate call approach

## Execution Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. **Environment Setup**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/antoinedubuc/Desktop/AI_Goodies/Theodore
   source venv/bin/activate  # If using virtual environment
   ```

2. **Required Dependencies**:
   - Theodore core components
   - Rate-limited Gemini solution
   - Pinecone database access
   - API keys configured

3. **File Dependencies**:
   ```

**Estimated Runtime:** 5-10 minutes (with rate limiting)

#### Option 2: Run Classification Retrieval Analysis
```bash
python test_saas_classification_retrieval.py
```

**Expected Output:**
- Database coverage analysis
- Individual company retrieval results
- Classification quality assessment
- Performance metrics

**Estimated Runtime:** 2-5 minutes

#### Option 3: Run Integrated Classification Test
```bash
python phase4_integrated_classification_test.py
```

**Expected Output:**
- Option B viability assessment
- Integrated prompt performance
- Classification accuracy analysis
- Recommendation for approach

**Estimated Runtime:** 3-7 minutes (with rate limiting)

#### ❌ **MAJOR ISSUES** Results
- Multiple critical failures
- Low success rates or poor quality
- **Action**: Investigate and fix core issues before proceeding

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Import Errors
```
❌ Import failed: No module named 'rate_limited_gemini_solution'
```
**Solution**: Ensure you're in the correct directory and the rate-limited solution file exists:
```bash
ls sandbox/search/singular_search/concurency_approach/concurency_and_rate_limiting_tests/rate_limited_gemini_solution.py
```

#### API Rate Limiting
```
❌ Quota exceeded or rate limited
```
**Solution**: Tests include built-in rate limiting. Wait between test runs or check API quota.

#### Database Connection Issues
```
❌ Pinecone connection failed
```
**Solution**: Verify environment variables and Pinecone API key configuration.

#### No Companies Found
```
⚠️ Company not found in database
```
**Expected**: Some test companies may not exist in your database yet. This is normal for new installations.

### Performance Issues

#### Slow Processing Times
- **Check**: Network connectivity
- **Verify**: API response times
- **Consider**: Reducing test company list for faster execution

#### Memory Issues
- **Reduce**: Number of concurrent operations
- **Monitor**: System memory usage during tests
- **Restart**: Python environment if needed

## Integration Next Steps

### After Successful Tests

1. **Review Results**: Analyze test output for production readiness
2. **Optimize Configuration**: Adjust rate limiting and performance settings
3. **Implement Integration**: Add classification to main Theodore pipeline
4. **Monitor Production**: Set up monitoring for classification quality
