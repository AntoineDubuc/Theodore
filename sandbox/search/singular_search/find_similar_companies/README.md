# Find Similar Companies Flow Test

This implementation tests the complete "Find Similar Companies" workflow using our rate-limited approach, combining Theodore's existing architecture with the proven rate limiting solution.

## Architecture Overview

Based on `sandbox/search/research_architecture.md`, the Find Similar Companies flow follows this pattern:

### Flow Phases

1. **Vector Database Query** (Fast)
   - Query Pinecone index for semantically similar companies
   - Use existing company embeddings for instant similarity matching
   - Return ranked results based on business model, industry, size

2. **LLM Expansion** (Rate-Limited, Conditional)
   - If insufficient results from vector search
   - Use rate-limited LLM to generate additional similar companies
   - Analyze existing results to understand similarity patterns

3. **Surface Scraping** (Rate-Limited)
   - Extract company overview from homepage only
   - Use rate-limited LLM analysis for business intelligence
   - Enhance LLM-suggested companies with real data

4. **Combine Results**
   - Merge vector database results with LLM-enhanced companies
   - Deduplicate and rank by similarity score
   - Format for UI display with research capabilities

## Key Features

### Rate Limiting Integration
- Uses `RateLimitedTheodoreLLMManager` for all LLM calls
- Token bucket algorithm prevents quota breaches
- 8 requests/minute configuration for Gemini free tier
- Real-time token status monitoring

### Theodore Architecture Compliance
- Integrates with existing `SimpleEnhancedDiscovery`
- Uses `PineconeClient` for vector database queries
- Leverages `BedrockClient` for embeddings
- Compatible with existing company data models

### Technical Characteristics
- **Speed**: Fast (leverages existing data + minimal scraping)
- **Depth**: Surface-level information
- **Storage**: Temporary results, not persisted
- **LLM Usage**: Discovery and expansion when needed (rate-limited)

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

```python
class RateLimitedSimilarCompaniesFlow:
    def __init__(self):
        # Rate-limited LLM manager (8 requests/minute)
        self.llm_manager = RateLimitedTheodoreLLMManager(
            max_workers=1,
            requests_per_minute=8
        )
        
        # Theodore clients
        self.pinecone_client = PineconeClient(...)
        self.bedrock_client = BedrockClient()
        self.discovery_engine = SimpleEnhancedDiscovery(...)
```

### Phase Implementations

#### Phase 1: Vector Database Query
```python
def _phase1_vector_database_query(self, company_name: str, max_results: int):
    # Check if target company exists in database
    target_company = self.pinecone_client.find_company_by_name(company_name)
    
    if target_company:
        # Use vector similarity search
        similar_companies = self.pinecone_client.find_similar_companies(
            target_company.embedding,
            limit=max_results,
            include_metadata=True
        )
    else:
        # Fallback to semantic search based on company name
        name_embedding = self.bedrock_client.get_embeddings(company_name)
        # ... semantic search logic
```

#### Phase 2: LLM Expansion (Rate-Limited)
```python
def _phase2_llm_expansion(self, company_name: str, needed_count: int):
    # Create rate-limited LLM task
    task = LLMTask(
        task_id=f"expansion_{company_name}_{int(time.time())}",
        prompt=prompt,
        context={"company_name": company_name}
    )
    
    # Process with rate limiting (respects 8 requests/minute)
    llm_result = self.llm_manager.worker_pool.process_task(task)
```

#### Phase 3: Surface Scraping (Rate-Limited)
```python
def _phase3_surface_scraping(self, llm_companies: List[Dict]):
    for company in llm_companies:
        if company.get("needs_research"):
            # Rate-limited homepage analysis
            surface_data = self._scrape_homepage_surface(
                company["name"], 
                company["website"]
            )
            # Enhance company data with scraped information
```

## Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Comprehensive Flow Test
Tests multiple companies with different scenarios:
- **Stripe**: Well-known company likely in database (vector search)
- **OpenAI**: Well-known company likely in database (vector search)
- **TestCorp Inc**: Unknown company (LLM expansion needed)
- **FakeCompany123**: Non-existent company (fallback testing)

### Test 2: Detailed Single Company
Comprehensive analysis of one company with full output for human evaluation:
- Complete phase breakdown with timing
- Rate limiting status monitoring
- Detailed result analysis
- JSON export for inspection

## Usage

### Basic Test
```bash
python find_similar_companies_flow_test.py
```

### Detailed Test
```bash
python find_similar_companies_flow_test.py --detailed
python find_similar_companies_flow_test.py --detailed --company "OpenAI"
```

## Expected Performance

### Free Tier Performance
- **Vector Query**: ~0.1-0.5 seconds (database lookup)
- **LLM Expansion**: ~6-8 seconds per call (rate-limited)
- **Surface Scraping**: ~5-7 seconds per company (rate-limited)
- **Total for 5 companies**: ~30-60 seconds

### Performance Breakdown
```
Company with Vector Results:
├── Phase 1: Vector Query (0.2s)
├── Phase 2: Skipped (sufficient results)
├── Phase 3: Skipped (no new companies)
└── Phase 4: Combine (0.1s)
Total: ~0.3s

Unknown Company with LLM Expansion:
├── Phase 1: Vector Query (0.2s) - minimal results
├── Phase 2: LLM Expansion (8.0s) - rate limited
├── Phase 3: Surface Scraping (15.0s) - 3 companies @ 5s each
└── Phase 4: Combine (0.1s)
Total: ~23.3s
```

## Rate Limiting Benefits

### Before Rate Limiting
- Immediate quota breaches with concurrent requests
- 100% failure rate with multiple companies
- Unpredictable behavior

### After Rate Limiting  
- 100% success rate within API constraints
- Predictable timing (7.5s intervals between LLM calls)
- Reliable operation for any number of companies

## Integration with Theodore

### API Endpoint Integration
This flow can be integrated into Theodore's Flask app as:

```python
@app.route('/api/find-similar', methods=['POST'])
def find_similar_companies():
    data = request.json
    company_name = data.get('company_name')
    max_results = data.get('max_results', 5)
    
    flow = RateLimitedSimilarCompaniesFlow()
    flow.start()
    
    try:
        result = flow.find_similar_companies(company_name, max_results)
        return jsonify(result)
    finally:
        flow.shutdown()
```

### UI Integration
Results format is compatible with Theodore's existing UI:

```javascript
// Each company includes research capability
{
  "name": "Company Name",
  "website": "https://company.com", 
  "similarity_score": 0.85,
  "relationship_type": "competitor",
  "source": "vector_similar",
  "research_status": "available",
  "can_research": true  // Enables "Research this company" button
}
```

## Future Enhancements

### Performance Optimizations
- **Batch LLM calls**: Process multiple companies in single request
- **Caching**: Cache LLM expansion results for common companies
- **Smart throttling**: Adjust rate limits based on API tier

### Quality Improvements
- **Google Search integration**: Real website discovery
- **Enhanced scraping**: Use Crawl4AI for JavaScript-heavy sites
- **Validation**: Verify LLM-suggested companies exist

### Scaling Capabilities
- **Paid tier support**: Higher rate limits for production use
- **Concurrent workers**: Multiple workers for paid API tiers
- **Background processing**: Queue-based processing for large requests

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the Find Similar Companies flow that respects API constraints while delivering reliable, high-quality results.
