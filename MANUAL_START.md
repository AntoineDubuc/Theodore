# üöÄ Manual Theodore Startup Instructions

The app has been fixed and made more robust. Follow these steps to start it manually:

## Step 1: Open Terminal

Open Terminal and navigate to the Theodore directory:
```bash
cd /Users/antoinedubuc/Desktop/AI_Goodies/Theodore
```

## Step 2: Stop Any Existing Processes

```bash
pkill -f "python.*app"
```

## Step 3: Start Theodore

```bash
python3 app.py
```

## Step 4: Test the App

Once started, you should see:
```
‚úÖ Startup pipeline initialization successful
üöÄ Starting Theodore Web UI...
üåê Access at: http://localhost:5002
```

Then test these URLs:
- **Main interface**: http://localhost:5002
- **Diagnostic page**: http://localhost:5002/diagnostic
- **Health check**: http://localhost:5002/api/health

## Step 5: If Pipeline Still Fails

If you see "‚ùå Startup pipeline initialization failed", the app will still start and you can:

1. Go to http://localhost:5002/diagnostic
2. See exactly what component is failing
3. The diagnostic will show which environment variables are missing

## What Was Fixed:

1. ‚úÖ **Syntax Error**: Fixed `await` outside async function
2. ‚úÖ **Traceback Error**: Fixed import issue in error handling  
3. ‚úÖ **Startup Robustness**: App won't crash if pipeline fails to initialize
4. ‚úÖ **Diagnostic System**: Full component-by-component testing

## Expected Result:

After running `python3 app.py`, you should be able to:
- Access the web interface
- Use the diagnostic page to troubleshoot any remaining issues
- Process companies without the "Theodore pipeline not initialized" error

The app is now much more robust and will provide clear diagnostic information if anything is still wrong.
