# Theodore - AI-Powered Company Intelligence System

🚀 **Transform raw survey data into actionable company intelligence with AI-powered web scraping and semantic search.**

Theodore automates the extraction and analysis of company information from websites, reducing manual research from 5-6 hours per 10-12 companies to minutes for hundreds of companies.

## 🎯 What Theodore Does

- **AI-Powered Web Scraping**: Uses Crawl4AI with LLMExtractionStrategy for intelligent content extraction
- **Multi-Model AI Analysis**: Leverages OpenAI GPT-4o-mini and AWS Bedrock for comprehensive analysis
- **Vector Search**: Pinecone integration for semantic company search and clustering
- **Cost-Optimized Storage**: 72% reduction in vector storage costs through metadata optimization
- **Production-Ready**: Async processing, caching, and enterprise-grade error handling

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- OpenAI API key
- AWS Bedrock access (optional)
- Pinecone account

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/theodore.git
cd theodore

# Set up virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from src.main_pipeline import TheodorePipeline
from src.models import CompanyIntelligenceConfig

# Initialize Theodore
config = CompanyIntelligenceConfig(max_companies=10)
pipeline = TheodorePipeline(config)

# Process companies from CSV
results = pipeline.process_survey_responses("data/companies.csv")

# Search for similar companies
similar = pipeline.semantic_search("AI SaaS startups", top_k=5)
```

## ✨ Key Features

### 🤖 AI-Powered Extraction

- **Schema-Based Extraction**: Structured JSON output using Pydantic models
- **Page-Priority System**: Dynamic extraction strategies based on page importance
- **Smart Chunking**: Adaptive token optimization (800-2500 tokens per page type)
- **Cost Optimization**: 33% reduction in extraction costs through intelligent parameter tuning

### 🔍 Intelligent Web Scraping

- **Multi-Page Crawling**: Homepage, about, services, team, contact pages
- **Content Filtering**: CSS selectors target main content, exclude navigation/ads
- **Caching Strategy**: Company-specific sessions reduce redundant API calls
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful degradation with comprehensive error handling

### 📊 Vector Storage & Search
