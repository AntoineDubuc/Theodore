# Theodore Coverage Improvement Roadmap

## 📊 Current Status Analysis
- **Total Companies**: 29
- **Classification Coverage**: 100% ✅
- **Critical Field Gaps**: 21 companies need enhancement

## 🎯 Priority Solutions (Ready to Implement)

### 1. **IMMEDIATE: Re-scraping with Enhanced Targeting**
**Problem**: Raw content lacks detailed information for field extraction
**Solution**: Deploy enhanced scraping for companies with poor field coverage

```bash
# Implementation Steps:
1. python3 scripts/utilities/identify_rescraping_candidates.py
2. python3 scripts/utilities/enhanced_rescrape_missing_fields.py
3. python3 scripts/utilities/verify_field_improvements.py
```

**Target Fields**: founding_year, location, leadership_team, contact_info, employee_count_range
**Expected Improvement**: 40-60% coverage increase

### 2. **SHORT TERM: Specialized Page Targeting**
**Problem**: Current scraper doesn't prioritize specific page types
**Solution**: Integrate specialized page scraper into main pipeline

**Target Pages**:
- `/about`, `/team`, `/leadership` → leadership_team, founding_year
- `/contact`, `/get-in-touch` → contact_info, location  
- `/partners`, `/partnerships` → partnerships
- `/awards`, `/press`, `/news` → awards, recent_news_events

**Expected Results**:
- Leadership coverage: 27.6% → 70%+
- Contact info coverage: 48.3% → 80%+
- Location coverage: 48.3% → 75%+

### 3. **MEDIUM TERM: AI-Enhanced Extraction**
**Problem**: Pattern matching misses contextual information
**Solution**: Use Nova Pro for structured field extraction

```python
# AI Extraction Prompt for Missing Fields
"Analyze this company website content and extract:
- Founding year (look for 'founded', 'established', 'since')
- Headquarters location (look for 'based in', 'headquarters')
- Leadership team (CEO, founders, executives)
- Contact information (email, phone, address)
- Company size indicators (employee count, 'team of X')

Return as structured JSON."
```
