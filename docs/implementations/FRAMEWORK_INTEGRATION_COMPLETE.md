  - Example framework outputs for reference

### **3. AI Pipeline Integration**
- **File**: `src/concurrent_intelligent_scraper.py`
- **Integration Point**: Phase 4b - After main business intelligence analysis
- **Process**: 
  1. Main analysis generates business intelligence
  2. Framework generator uses that data for structured classification
  3. Validation ensures quality and format compliance
  4. Framework output stored in company data

- **Added**: Column BP mapping for `business_model_framework`
- **Export**: Framework descriptions automatically exported to spreadsheets
- **Batch Processing**: Included in all batch processing workflows

### **5. UI Display Integration**
- **File**: `static/js/app.js`
- **Enhancements**:
  - Added framework display to Business Intelligence section
  - Created missing `renderClassificationSection()` function
  - Framework shows in research data cards
  - Detailed company modals include framework output
  - Proper formatting and validation display

### **6. Comprehensive Testing**
- **File**: `test_framework_integration.py` (NEW)
- **Features**:
  - End-to-end integration testing
  - Framework validation and quality scoring
  - Performance metrics and timing
  - Detailed error reporting and debugging

## 🎯 Framework Output Examples

The system will generate outputs like:

**Stripe:**
> "Transaction-based (online businesses pay per-transaction fees typically 2.9% + 30¢ for payment processing infrastructure that handles credit cards, international payments, and fraud prevention, enabling companies to accept payments without building complex payment systems)"

**Shopify:**
> "SaaS (e-commerce businesses pay monthly subscription fees ranging from $29-$299+ for hosted online store platform with payment processing, inventory management, and marketing tools, generating recurring revenue as merchants grow their sales volume)"

**Figma:**
> "SaaS (design teams and professionals pay monthly per-editor subscription fees starting at $12/editor for collaborative design platform that enables real-time design collaboration, prototyping, and design system management, replacing traditional desktop design tools)"

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### **Processing Flow:**
```
1. Website Scraping (4-phase intelligent extraction)
   ↓
2. Business Intelligence Analysis (JSON structured data)
   ↓
3. Framework Generation (David's specific prompt)
   ↓
4. Validation & Quality Check
   ↓
5. Storage (CompanyData + Pinecone + Google Sheets)
   ↓
6. UI Display (Research cards + Details modal)
```

### **Cost Impact:**
- **Additional Cost**: ~$0.0001 per company (negligible)
- **Processing Time**: +0.5-1.0 seconds per company
- **Token Usage**: ~500 additional tokens per framework generation

### **Quality Assurance:**
- **Format Validation**: Ensures [Type] ([Mechanism]) structure
- **Content Validation**: Verifies WHO/WHAT/HOW/WHY elements
- **Length Control**: Enforces 1-2 sentence maximum
- **Business Accuracy**: Leverages Theodore's comprehensive analysis

## 🚀 Testing & Deployment

### **Ready for Testing:**
```bash
# Quick integration test
python test_framework_integration.py
