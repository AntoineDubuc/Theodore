## Test Overview
Testing David's Business Model Description Framework with simulated company data to validate approach before full integration.

## Framework Requirements Analysis

### David's Framework Structure:
```
[Primary Model Type] ([Brief Value Mechanism Description])
```

### Primary Model Types (11 options):
- SaaS - Software as a Service/subscription-based software
- Product Sales - One-time hardware/software product sales  
- Hardware-enabled SaaS - Hardware + recurring software/service fees
- Manufacturing - Mass production and supply contracts
- Enterprise Software - Licensed platforms for large organizations
- Technology Licensing - IP/patent licensing to other companies
- Consulting Services - Professional expertise and advisory services
- Managed Services - Ongoing operational support and management
- Project-based Services - Contract-based project delivery
- Transaction-based - Fees per transaction/usage
- Subscription-based - Recurring access fees
- Marketplace/Platform - Commission on transactions between parties

### Required Elements in Value Mechanism:
- **WHO** pays (customer type)
- **WHAT** they pay for (product/service)  
- **HOW** pricing works (per-user, per-transaction, fixed fee, etc.)
- **WHY** customers pay (value received)

## Test Case: Stripe

### Input Data (Theodore-style analysis):
