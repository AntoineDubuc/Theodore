# Intelligent Scraper Verification Summary

## User Question
"Currently, is the code reading the robot.txt and from pushing that to an llm retrieving the best pages for the about contact etc.? This is how it should be done. If there is nothing relevant in robot.txt then the main page could be crawled for links, those sent to an llm again to retrieve/map the pages, no?"

## Answer: YES âœ…

The intelligent scraper (`src/intelligent_company_scraper.py`) already implements exactly this approach:

### Current Implementation Flow

```
1. Phase 1: Comprehensive Link Discovery
   â”œâ”€â”€ Read robots.txt for links and sitemaps
   â”œâ”€â”€ Parse sitemap.xml (and nested sitemaps)
   â””â”€â”€ Recursive crawl of main pages for additional links

2. Phase 2: LLM-Driven Page Selection  
   â”œâ”€â”€ Send all discovered links to LLM
   â”œâ”€â”€ LLM analyzes and selects most promising pages
   â””â”€â”€ Fallback to heuristic selection if LLM unavailable

3. Phase 3: Parallel Content Extraction
   â”œâ”€â”€ Extract content from selected pages in parallel
   â””â”€â”€ Use Crawl4AI with AI-powered extraction

4. Phase 4: AI Content Aggregation
   â””â”€â”€ Aggregate and analyze all extracted content
```

### Code Evidence

#### 1. Robots.txt Reading (Lines 195-219)
```python
async def _parse_robots_txt(self, session: aiohttp.ClientSession, base_url: str) -> Set[str]:
    """Parse robots.txt for sitemap URLs and paths"""
    robots_url = urljoin(base_url, '/robots.txt')
    links = set()
    
    try:
        async with session.get(robots_url) as response:
            if response.status == 200:
                content = await response.text()
                
                # Extract sitemap URLs
                sitemap_pattern = r'Sitemap:\s*(.+)'
                sitemaps = re.findall(sitemap_pattern, content, re.IGNORECASE)
                links.update(sitemaps)
```

#### 2. Sitemap.xml Parsing (Lines 221-281)
```python
async def _parse_sitemap(self, session: aiohttp.ClientSession, base_url: str) -> Set[str]:
    """Parse sitemap.xml for comprehensive URL list"""
    # Handles regular sitemaps and sitemap indexes
    # Recursively parses nested sitemaps
```

#### 3. LLM Page Selection (Lines 378-458)
```python
async def _llm_select_promising_pages(self, all_links: List[str], company_name: str, base_url: str) -> List[str]:
    """Phase 2: Use LLM to select most promising pages for sales intelligence"""
    
    prompt = f"""You are a data extraction specialist analyzing {company_name}'s website...
    
    Select up to 50 pages that are MOST LIKELY to contain these CRITICAL missing data points:
    
    ðŸ”´ HIGHEST PRIORITY (Currently missing from our database):
    1. **Contact & Location**: Physical address, headquarters location
       â†’ Look for: /contact, /about, /offices, /locations
    2. **Founded Year**: When the company was established
       â†’ Look for: /about, /our-story, /history, /company
    3. **Employee Count**: Team size or number of employees  
       â†’ Look for: /about, /team, /careers, /jobs
    ...
    """
```

### Improvements Made

Based on the missing data analysis, I enhanced the LLM prompt to specifically target:

1. **Contact & Location** (0% fill rate â†’ targeting /contact, /about)
2. **Founded Year** (0% fill rate â†’ targeting /about, /history) 
3. **Employee Count** (0% fill rate â†’ targeting /careers, /team)
4. **Social Media Links** (0% fill rate â†’ targeting footer, /contact)
5. **Products/Services** (0% fill rate â†’ targeting /products, /services)
6. **Leadership Team** (0% fill rate â†’ targeting /team, /leadership)
7. **Partnerships** (0% fill rate â†’ targeting /partners, /integrations)
8. **Certifications** (0% fill rate â†’ targeting /security, /compliance)

### Heuristic Fallback Updates

When LLM is unavailable, the heuristic selection now prioritizes:
- **High priority**: contact, about, team, leadership, careers, jobs
- **Medium priority**: products, services, partners, security, compliance
- **Low priority**: pricing, customers, news, press

### Testing the Improvements

Run the test script to verify:
```bash
python test_enhanced_page_selection.py
```

This will show:
1. How many links are discovered from robots.txt/sitemap
2. Which pages the LLM selects for missing data
3. Sample extraction from selected pages

### Summary

âœ… **The intelligent scraper already implements the exact flow you described**
âœ… **Reads robots.txt â†’ Finds sitemaps â†’ Crawls for more links â†’ LLM selects best pages**
âœ… **Enhanced to specifically target the missing data points (location, founding year, etc.)**
âœ… **Ready to significantly improve field extraction rates**
