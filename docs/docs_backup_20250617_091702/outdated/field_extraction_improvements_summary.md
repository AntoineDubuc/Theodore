# Field Extraction Improvements Summary

## Problem Identified
When reviewing the Google Sheets, we noticed that many columns contained `[]` (empty arrays) instead of being blank, and many important fields were not being extracted despite likely being available on company websites.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Empty Array Display (✅ Completed)
**File**: `config/sheets_field_mapping.py`

Changed the `convert_value_for_sheets` function to:
- Return empty string `""` instead of `[]` for empty lists
- Return empty string `""` instead of `{}` for empty dictionaries
- Provides cleaner appearance in spreadsheets

### 2. Field Extraction Analysis (✅ Completed)
**File**: `analyze_field_extraction.py`

Analyzed 8 companies and found:
- **High fill rate (>90%)**: Basic fields like ID, name, website, scrape status
- **Medium fill rate (50-90%)**: Industry, business model, company size, tech stack
- **Low fill rate (<10%)**: Location, founding year, social media, certifications, partnerships

Key findings:
- Many array fields completely empty (0% fill rate)
- Important business fields missing despite likely being on websites
- Pattern-based extraction could significantly improve results

### 3. Enhanced Extraction System (✅ Completed)
**File**: `src/extraction_improvements.py`

Created `EnhancedFieldExtractor` class with:

#### Pattern-Based Extraction
- **Founding Year**: Patterns like "founded in 2010", "since 1995", "©2020-2024"
- **Employee Count**: "50-100 employees", "team of 200", "500+ people"
- **Location**: "headquartered in San Francisco", "based in New York, NY"
- **Social Media**: Extract handles from URLs (twitter.com/handle, linkedin.com/company/name)
- **Contact Info**: Email patterns, phone numbers, addresses
- **Certifications**: ISO 9001, SOC 2, GDPR compliant, HIPAA compliant
- **Partnerships**: Extract company names near "partners with", "integrates with"

#### Smart Extraction Logic
```python
# Example: Extract founding year
if 'founded in 2010' in content:
    → founding_year = 2010

# Example: Extract employee count
if '50-100 employees' in content:
    → employee_count_range = "50-100"
```

### 4. Pipeline Integration (✅ Completed)
**File**: `src/main_pipeline.py`

Enhanced the `process_single_company` method to:
1. Run standard AI extraction (Bedrock)
2. Apply pattern-based extraction for missing fields
3. Use Gemini with detailed prompts for remaining gaps
4. Three-layer approach ensures maximum field coverage

### 5. Enhanced AI Prompts
Added specific extraction prompts that tell the AI exactly what to look for:
- Founding year patterns
- Employee count indicators
- Location formats
- Social media links
- Contact information
- Certifications and compliance
- Partnership mentions

## Expected Improvements

### Before Improvements
- Founding year: 0% filled
- Employee count: 0% filled
- Location: 0% filled
- Social media: 0% filled
- Certifications: 0% filled
- Overall average: ~40% fields filled

### After Improvements
- Founding year: 60-70% (when mentioned on site)
- Employee count: 50-60% (from about/careers pages)
- Location: 70-80% (usually on contact page)
- Social media: 80-90% (footer links)
- Certifications: 40-50% (when applicable)
- Overall average: 55-65% fields filled

## How It Works

### 1. Initial Scraping
```
Website → Intelligent Scraper → Raw Content
```

### 2. Three-Layer Extraction
```
Layer 1: Bedrock AI Analysis
  ↓ (basic fields extracted)
Layer 2: Pattern-Based Extraction
  ↓ (founding year, location, social media)
Layer 3: Gemini Detailed Extraction
  ↓ (remaining complex fields)
Final: Complete Company Data
```

### 3. Example Flow
```
connatix.com scraped
→ Bedrock: industry="video ad tech", business_model="B2B"
→ Patterns: founding_year=2014 (found "since 2014")
→ Patterns: location="New York, NY" (found "headquartered in New York")
→ Patterns: social_media={twitter: "connatix", linkedin: "connatix"}
→ Gemini: certifications=["ISO 27001", "SOC 2 Type II"]
→ Result: 65% fields filled (vs 40% before)
```

## Usage

The improvements are automatically applied when processing companies:

```python
# All improvements active by default
company_data = pipeline.process_single_company(
    company_name="example.com",
    website="example.com"
)
```

## Testing the Improvements

1. Process a new company:
```bash
python test_enhanced_extraction.py --company "salesforce.com"
```

2. Reprocess existing companies:
```bash
python reprocess_with_enhancements.py --sheet-id "YOUR_SHEET_ID"
```

## Next Steps

### Additional Improvements Possible
1. **Page-Specific Extraction**: Target specific pages (about, contact, team)
2. **Industry-Specific Patterns**: Custom patterns for different industries
3. **ML-Based Extraction**: Train models on successful extractions
4. **Visual Extraction**: Extract from logos, images, PDFs
5. **API Enrichment**: Use external APIs for missing data

### Recommended Actions
1. Reprocess existing companies with enhancements
2. Monitor fill rates to identify new patterns
3. Add industry-specific extraction rules
4. Create feedback loop to improve patterns

## Conclusion

These improvements should significantly reduce empty fields in the spreadsheet by:
- Eliminating `[]` and `{}` display issues
- Extracting 15-25% more fields per company
- Focusing on high-value business fields
- Using multiple extraction strategies

The system now employs a sophisticated three-layer approach that combines AI analysis with pattern matching and targeted prompts to maximize field extraction while maintaining data quality.
