# Real Google Search Setup for Job Listings

## ðŸŽ¯ You asked for REAL Google search, here's how to set it up:

The job listings crawler now implements **actual Google search** instead of just asking an LLM. Here are the configuration options:

## ðŸ”§ Option 1: Google Custom Search API (Recommended)

1. **Get Google API Key:**
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or use existing
   - Enable "Custom Search API"
   - Create API credentials

2. **Create Custom Search Engine:**
   - Go to [Google Custom Search](https://cse.google.com/cse/)
   - Create a new search engine
   - Set it to search the entire web
   - Get your Search Engine ID

3. **Add to .env file:**
   ```bash
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
   GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=your_search_engine_id_here
   ```

## ðŸ”§ Option 2: SerpAPI (Easy Setup)

1. **Get SerpAPI Key:**
   - Go to [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/)
   - Sign up for free account (100 searches/month free)
   - Get your API key

2. **Add to .env file:**
   ```bash
   SERPAPI_KEY=your_serpapi_key_here
   ```

## ðŸ”§ Option 3: Direct Google Search (May Be Blocked)

This is the fallback option and may not work due to Google's bot detection.

## ðŸ§ª How the Real Google Search Works:

1. **Search Queries:** 
   - "MSI careers"
   - "MSI jobs" 
   - "MSI hiring"
   - "site:msi.com careers"

2. **Result Processing:**
   - Finds URLs from Google results
   - Filters for career-related URLs
   - Crawls each discovered career page
   - Extracts actual job listings

3. **Success Scenarios:**
   - Discovers `https://ca.msi.com/about/careers`
   - Crawls the page for job listings
   - Returns real job data instead of generic advice

## ðŸ“Š Expected Results:

**Before (LLM knowledge):**
```
Job Listings: Try: LinkedIn, their careers page, AngelList
```

**After (Real Google search):**
```
Job Listings: Yes - 5 open positions
Career Page Found: https://ca.msi.com/about/careers  
Source: google_search_success
Search Query: MSI careers
```

## ðŸš€ Benefits of Real Google Search:

- âœ… **Discovers actual career pages** (like ca.msi.com/about/careers)
- âœ… **Finds real job listings** instead of generic advice
- âœ… **Crawls discovered pages** for current openings
- âœ… **Returns specific URLs** users can visit
- âœ… **Works for any company** that has discoverable career pages
