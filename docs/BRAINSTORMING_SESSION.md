# Theodore Brainstorming Session

## Original User Problem (The "Why" Behind Theodore)

**Core Issue**: David Fishman needed to research 400 companies who opted into CloudGeometry's survey, but the manual process was unsustainable:

- **Manual bottleneck**: Researching companies one-by-one through CRM records and websites
- **Time sink**: 5-6 hours to create a simple table for all 400 companies  
- **API limitations**: Could only submit 10-12 companies at a time to GPT
- **Repetitive work**: Generating the same type of concise summaries (problems solved, key tech, sales relevance)
- **Integration gap**: Needed to automatically feed summaries to HubSpot API when surveys completed

**User's Vision**: "When someone completes a survey, I'd like to kick off this kind of summary in the background and feed it to a HubSpot API"

**Theodore's Purpose**: Transform a 5-6 hour manual research process into automated background processing that scales to hundreds of companies and integrates with existing workflows.
