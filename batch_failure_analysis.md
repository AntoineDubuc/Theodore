# Batch Processing Failure Analysis

## Summary

The three companies that failed during batch processing (jelli.com, adtheorent.com, lotlinx.com) all failed for different reasons related to domain redirects and path selection issues.

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. jelli.com ❌ Failed (Row 3) - "No content extracted from pages"

**Root Cause**: Domain redirect issue causing 404 errors

- **Discovery Phase**: ✅ Success - Found 257 paths
  - Domain redirect: jelli.com → tritondigital.com
  - Successfully discovered paths from tritondigital.com
  
- **Selection Phase**: ✅ Success - Nova Pro selected 13 valuable paths
  - Selected paths like `/about/our-story`, `/about/careers`, etc.
  
- **Crawling Phase**: ❌ Failed - All pages returned 404 errors
  - **PROBLEM**: The crawler tried to fetch `https://jelli.com/about/our-story` instead of `https://tritondigital.com/about/our-story`
  - The domain normalization in discovery phase wasn't propagated to the crawling phase
  
- **Result**: No content extracted because all pages failed to load

### 2. adtheorent.com ❌ Failed (Row 7) - "Path selection failed: "

**Root Cause**: No valuable paths found by Nova Pro

- **Discovery Phase**: ✅ Success - Found only 7 paths
  - Domain redirect: adtheorent.com → thenewcadent.com
  - Very small website with mostly privacy/legal pages
  
- **Selection Phase**: ❌ Failed - Nova Pro found 0 valuable paths
  - Even with lowered confidence threshold (0.3), no paths were selected
  - Available paths were: `/`, `/ccpa-job-applicant-privacy-notice`, `/services-privacy-policy`, etc.
  - These are all privacy/legal pages with no business intelligence value
  
- **Result**: No content to crawl or extract

### 3. lotlinx.com ❌ Failed (Row 6) - "Path selection failed: Failed to process Nova Pro response: No JSON found in Nova Pro response"

**Root Cause**: Nova Pro returned 0 selected paths despite having 549 options

- **Discovery Phase**: ✅ Success - Found 578 paths
  - No domain redirect issues
  - Rich website with lots of content pages
  
- **Selection Phase**: ❌ Failed - Nova Pro selected 0 paths
  - Had 549 first-level paths to choose from
  - Paths included valuable ones like `/about-us`, `/artificial-intelligence-at-nada-2025`, etc.
  - **PROBLEM**: Either the prompt is too restrictive or Nova Pro had an issue processing the large list
  - The "No JSON found in Nova Pro response" error suggests Nova Pro might have returned an explanation instead of the expected JSON format
  
- **Result**: No content to crawl or extract

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Domain Redirect Handling**:
   - Ensure the normalized domain from discovery phase is used consistently in crawling phase
   - The base_url parameter needs to match the actual domain being crawled

2. **Handle Small/Privacy-Only Websites**:
   - Add fallback to crawl homepage when no valuable paths are found
   - Consider relaxing selection criteria for very small sites

3. **Improve Path Selection Robustness**:
   - Add better error handling for Nova Pro responses
   - Consider chunking large path lists to avoid overwhelming the LLM
   - Add fallback selection heuristics when LLM fails

4. **Specific Fixes Needed**:
   - In `crawl_selected_pages_sync`: Use the normalized domain from discovery
   - In `filter_valuable_links_sync`: Add JSON validation and retry logic
   - In batch processor: Add domain normalization consistency across phases
