# Theodore - Company Intelligence Implementation Checklist

## Project Overview
Building an AI-powered company intelligence system to process survey responses and generate sector-based insights for sales teams.

**Inspired by:** [ottomator-agents/crawl4AI-agent](https://github.com/coleam00/ottomator-agents/tree/main/crawl4AI-agent)

## Core Architecture
- **Web Scraping:** Crawl4AI for intelligent content extraction
- **Data Modeling:** Pydantic for structured validation
- **Embeddings:** AWS Bedrock (Titan/Claude models)
- **Vector Storage:** Pinecone for similarity search
- **Graph Database:** Neo4j for relationship mapping
- **Processing:** Batch processing 400+ companies

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup

### Environment & Dependencies
- [ ] Python 3.13+ environment setup
- [ ] Install core packages:
  - [ ] `crawl4ai`
  - [ ] `boto3` (AWS Bedrock)
  - [ ] `pinecone-client`
  - [ ] `neo4j`
  - [ ] `pydantic`
  - [ ] `streamlit` (for UI)
- [ ] AWS credentials configuration
- [ ] Pinecone API key setup
- [ ] Neo4j instance setup (local or cloud)

### Data Models (Pydantic)
- [ ] `CompanyData` model
  - [ ] Basic info (name, website, industry)
  - [ ] Tech stack detection
  - [ ] Business model classification
  - [ ] Pain points extraction
  - [ ] Embedding storage
- [ ] `SectorCluster` model
- [ ] `SimilarityRelation` model

## Phase 2: Core Components

- [ ] Adapt ottomator's crawl4AI implementation
- [ ] Company website content extraction
- [ ] Intelligent chunking for business context
- [ ] Error handling and rate limiting
- [ ] Content cleaning and preprocessing

### AI Integration
- [ ] Bedrock client setup
- [ ] Embedding generation (Titan Embeddings)
- [ ] Company intelligence extraction prompts
- [ ] Sector classification logic
- [ ] Tech stack detection patterns

### Data Storage
- [ ] Pinecone index creation
- [ ] Vector storage and retrieval
- [ ] Neo4j graph schema design
- [ ] Company nodes and relationships
- [ ] Metadata storage optimization

## Phase 3: Intelligence Features

### Similarity Analysis
- [ ] Company-to-company similarity
- [ ] Sector clustering algorithms
- [ ] Group vector comparison
- [ ] Similarity threshold tuning

### Sector Intelligence
- [ ] Automatic sector detection
- [ ] Cross-sector relationship mapping
- [ ] Industry trend analysis
- [ ] Competitive positioning

### Graph Relationships
- [ ] `SIMILAR_TO` relationships
- [ ] `BELONGS_TO_SECTOR` connections
- [ ] `SHARES_TECH` edges
- [ ] `COMPETES_WITH` links

## Phase 4: Processing Pipeline

### Batch Processing
- [ ] CSV input handler
- [ ] Bulk company processing
- [ ] Progress tracking and logging
- [ ] Error recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Output generation

### Data Pipeline
- [ ] Input: Survey CSV (400 companies)
- [ ] Process: Web scraping + AI analysis
- [ ] Storage: Vectors + Graph
- [ ] Output: Sector insights + recommendations

## Phase 5: User Interface

### Streamlit Dashboard
- [ ] Company search and visualization
- [ ] Sector cluster browser
- [ ] Similarity exploration
- [ ] Graph relationship viewer
- [ ] Export functionality

### Outputs
- [ ] Enhanced CSV with AI insights
- [ ] Sector analysis reports
- [ ] HubSpot integration format
- [ ] Interactive exploration tools

## Phase 6: Testing & Validation

### Single Company PoC
- [ ] Test with one company website
- [ ] Validate data extraction
- [ ] Verify embedding generation
- [ ] Check graph storage

### Batch Testing
- [ ] Process small batch (10 companies)
- [ ] Validate sector clustering
- [ ] Test similarity algorithms
- [ ] Performance optimization

### Integration Testing
- [ ] End-to-end pipeline test
- [ ] CSV input/output validation
- [ ] Error handling verification
- [ ] Performance benchmarking

## Technical Specifications

### Data Flow
```
CSV Input → Company URLs → Crawl4AI → Content Extraction 
→ Bedrock Analysis → Embeddings → Pinecone Storage 
→ Neo4j Relationships → Sector Clustering → Intelligence Reports
```

### Key Adaptations from Ottomator
- Replace Supabase → Pinecone
- Replace OpenAI → AWS Bedrock
- Documentation focus → Company intelligence
- Add Neo4j graph relationships
- Add sector clustering logic

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Successfully process 400 companies
- [ ] Generate meaningful sector clusters
- [ ] Achieve >80% accuracy in company classification
- [ ] Reduce manual research time from 20+ hours to <1 hour
- [ ] Enable exploration of company relationships

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Real-time company monitoring
- [ ] Integration with CRM systems
- [ ] Predictive scoring models
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] API endpoint creation
